Furthermore, 'pencil' decomposition refers to a domain  decomposed in two different directions (i.e., with Rx != 1 and Ry != 1), while 'slab' decomposition  refers to a domain decomposed only in one direction, (i.e., with either Rx == 1 or Ry == 1).

Furthermore, any (x y) decompositions other than the configurations mentioned above are also not supported.\n\nAlgorithm for pencil decompositions\n\nFor pencil decompositions (useful for three-dimensional problems), there are three forward transforms,  three backward transforms, and four transpositions that require MPI communication.  In the algorithm below, the first dimension is always the local dimension.

Then the process is reversed to obtain storage.zfield in physical space partitioned over (x y).\n\nAlgorithm for stencil decompositions\n\nThe stecil decomposition algorithm works in the same manner as the pencil decompostion described above while skipping the transposes that are not required.

TX, TY, and TZ specify whether the x-, y-, and z directions are             Periodic, Bounded, or Flat. The topology Flat indicates that a model does             not vary in those directions so that derivatives and interpolation are zero.             The default is topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded).\nextent: A tuple prescribing the physical extent of the grid in non-Flat directions, e.g.,           (Lx, Ly, Lz). All directions are constructed with regular grid spacing and the domain           (in the case that no direction is Flat) is 0  x  L_x, 0  y  L_y, and           -L_z  z  0, which is most appropriate for oceanic applications in which z = 0           usually is the ocean's surface.\nx, y, and z: Each of x, y, z are either (i) 2-tuples that specify the end points of the domain                    in their respect directions (in which case scalar values may be used in Flat                    directions), or (ii) arrays or functions of the corresponding indices i, j, or k                    that specify the locations of cell faces in the x-, y-, or z-direction, respectively.                    For example, to prescribe the cell faces in z we need to provide a function that takes                    k as argument and returns the location of the faces for indices k = 1 through k = Nz + 1,                    where Nz is the size of the stretched z dimension.\n\nNote: Either extent, or all of x, y, and z must be specified.\n\nhalo: A tuple of integers that specifies the size of the halo region of cells surrounding         the physical interior for each non-Flat direction. The default is 3 halo cells in every direction.\n\nThe physical extent of the domain can be specified either via x, y, and z keyword arguments indicating the left and right endpoints of each dimensions, e.g., x = (-π, π) or via the extent argument, e.g., extent = (Lx, Ly, Lz), which specifies the extent of each dimension in which case 0  x  L_x, 0  y  L_y, and -L_z  z  0.\n\nA grid topology may be specified via a tuple assigning one of Periodic, Bounded, and, Flat to each dimension. By default, a horizontally periodic grid topology (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded) is assumed.\n\nConstants are stored using floating point values of type FT. By default this is Float64.

For example, stride=1 computs output every iteration, whereas stride=2 computes output every other iteration. Time-averages with longer strides are faster to compute, but less accurate.\n\nThe time-average of a is a left Riemann sum corresponding to\n\na = T¹ int_tᵢ-T^tᵢ a mathrmd t  \n\nwhere a is the time-average of a, T is the time-window for averaging, and the tᵢ are discrete times separated by the time interval.

Domains can take a variety of shapes, including\nlines (one-dimensional),\nrectangles (two-dimensional),\nboxes (three-dimensional),\nsectors of a thin spherical shells (two- or three-dimensional).\nIrregular domains – such as domains that include bathymetry or topography – are represented by using a masking technique to \"immerse\" an irregular boundary within an \"underlying\" regular grid. Part of specifying the shape of the domain also requires specifying the nature of each dimension, which may be\nPeriodic, which means that the dimension circles back onto itself: information leaving the left side of the domain re-enters on the right.\nBounded, which means that the two sides of the dimension are either impenetrable (solid walls), or \"open\", representing a specified external state.\nFlat, which means nothing can vary in that dimension, reducing the overall dimensionality of the grid.\nDefining the number of cells that divide each dimension. The number of cells, with or without explicit specification of the cell interfaces, determines the spatial resolution of the grid.\nThe representation of floating point numbers, which can be single-precision (Float32) or double precision (Float64).","category":"page"},{"location":"grids/","page":"Grids","title":"Grids","text":"Let's dive into each of these options in more detail.","category":"page"},{"location":"grids/#Specifying-the-machine-architecture","page":"Grids","title":"Specifying the machine architecture","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"grids/","page":"Grids","title":"Grids","text":"The positional argument CPU() or GPU(), specifies the \"architecture\" of the simulation.

This algorithm can be made even more efficient by solving a tridiagonal system along one of the dimensions and utilizing cyclic reduction. This results in the Fourier analysis cyclic reduction or textFACR(ell) algorithm (with ell cyclic reduction steps) which requires only mathcalO(N log_2log_2 N) operations provided the optimal number of cyclic reduction steps is taken, which is ell = log_2 log_2 n where n is the number of grid points in the cyclic reduction dimension. The FACR algorithm was first developed by Hockney (1969) and is well reviewed by Swarztrauber (1977) then further benchmarked and extended by Temperton (1979) and Temperton (1980).","category":"page"},{"location":"numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers/","page":"Elliptic solvers","title":"Elliptic solvers","text":"Furthermore, the FACR algorithm removes the restriction that the grid is uniform in one of the dimensions so it can be utilized to implement a fast Poisson solver for vertically stretched grids if the cyclic reduction is applied in the along the vertical dimension.","category":"page"},{"location":"numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers/","page":"Elliptic solvers","title":"Elliptic solvers","text":"Expanding p_NH and mathscrF into Fourier modes along the x and y directions","category":"page"},{"location":"numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers/","page":"Elliptic solvers","title":"Elliptic solvers","text":"p_ijk = sum_m=1^N_x sum_n=1^N_y tildep_mnk  e^-mathrmi 2pi i m  N_x   e^-mathrmi 2pi j n  N_y  ","category":"page"},{"location":"numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers/","page":"Elliptic solvers","title":"Elliptic solvers","text":"and recalling that Fourier transforms do partial_x rightarrow mathrmi k_x and partial_y rightarrow mathrmi k_y we can write \\eqref{eq:poisson-pressure} as","category":"page"},{"location":"numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers/","page":"Elliptic solvers","title":"Elliptic solvers","text":"sum_m=1^N_x sum_n=1^N_y\nleftlbrace\n    partial_z^2 tildep_mnk - (k_x^2 + k_y^2) tildep_mnk - tildemathscrF_mnk\nrightrbrace e^-mathrmi 2 pi i m  N_x  e^-mathrmi 2 pi j n  N_y = 0  ","category":"page"},{"location":"numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers/","page":"Elliptic solvers","title":"Elliptic solvers","text":"Discretizing the partial_z^2 derivative and equating the term inside the brackets to zero we arrive at N_xtimes N_y symmetric tridiagonal systems of N_z linear equations for the Fourier modes:","category":"page"},{"location":"numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers/","page":"Elliptic solvers","title":"Elliptic solvers","text":"fractildep_mn k-1Delta z^C_k\n- leftlbrace frac1Delta z^C_k + frac1Delta z^C_k+1 + Delta z^F_k (k_x^2 + k_y^2) rightrbrace\n  tildep_mnk\n+ fractildep_mn k+1Delta z^C_k+1\n= Delta z^F_k tildemathscrF_mnk  ","category":"page"},{"location":"numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers/#Cosine-transforms-on-the-GPU","page":"Elliptic solvers","title":"Cosine transforms on the GPU","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"numerical_implementation/elliptic_solvers/","page":"Elliptic solvers","title":"Elliptic solvers","text":"Unfortunately cuFFT does not provide cosine transforms and so we must write our own fast cosine  transforms for the GPU.
