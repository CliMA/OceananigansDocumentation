Furthermore, 'pencil' decomposition refers to a domain  decomposed in two different directions (i.e., with Rx != 1 and Ry != 1), while 'slab' decomposition  refers to a domain decomposed only in one direction, (i.e., with either Rx == 1 or Ry == 1).

Furthermore, any (x y) decompositions other than the configurations mentioned above are also not supported.\n\nAlgorithm for pencil decompositions\n\nFor pencil decompositions (useful for three-dimensional problems), there are three forward transforms,  three backward transforms, and four transpositions that require MPI communication.  In the algorithm below, the first dimension is always the local dimension.

Then the process is reversed to obtain storage.zfield in physical space partitioned over (x y).\n\nAlgorithm for stencil decompositions\n\nThe stecil decomposition algorithm works in the same manner as the pencil decompostion described above while skipping the transposes that are not required.

TX, TY, and TZ specify whether the x-, y-, and z directions are             Periodic, Bounded, or Flat. The topology Flat indicates that a model does             not vary in those directions so that derivatives and interpolation are zero.             The default is topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded).\nextent: A tuple prescribing the physical extent of the grid in non-Flat directions, e.g.,           (Lx, Ly, Lz). All directions are constructed with regular grid spacing and the domain           (in the case that no direction is Flat) is 0  x  L_x, 0  y  L_y, and           -L_z  z  0, which is most appropriate for oceanic applications in which z = 0           usually is the ocean's surface.\nx, y, and z: Each of x, y, z are either (i) 2-tuples that specify the end points of the domain                    in their respect directions (in which case scalar values may be used in Flat                    directions), or (ii) arrays or functions of the corresponding indices i, j, or k                    that specify the locations of cell faces in the x-, y-, or z-direction, respectively.                    For example, to prescribe the cell faces in z we need to provide a function that takes                    k as argument and returns the location of the faces for indices k = 1 through k = Nz + 1,                    where Nz is the size of the stretched z dimension.\n\nNote: Either extent, or all of x, y, and z must be specified.\n\nhalo: A tuple of integers that specifies the size of the halo region of cells surrounding         the physical interior for each non-Flat direction. The default is 3 halo cells in every direction.\n\nThe physical extent of the domain can be specified either via x, y, and z keyword arguments indicating the left and right endpoints of each dimensions, e.g., x = (-π, π) or via the extent argument, e.g., extent = (Lx, Ly, Lz), which specifies the extent of each dimension in which case 0  x  L_x, 0  y  L_y, and -L_z  z  0.\n\nA grid topology may be specified via a tuple assigning one of Periodic, Bounded, and, Flat to each dimension. By default, a horizontally periodic grid topology (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded) is assumed.\n\nConstants are stored using floating point values of type FT. By default this is Float64.
