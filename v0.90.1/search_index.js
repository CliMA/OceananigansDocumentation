In the schematic below, the first dimension is always the local dimension. In our implementation of the PencilFFTs algorithm, we require either Nz >= Rx, or Nz >= Ry, where Nz is the number of vertical cells, Rx is the number of ranks in x, and Ry is the number of ranks in y.

Then the process is reversed to obtain first(storage) in physical space and with the layout (z x y).\n\nRestrictions\n\nThe algorithm for two-dimensional decompositions requires that Nz = size(global_grid, 3) is larger than either Rx = ranks[1] or Ry = ranks[2], where ranks are configured when building Distributed. If Nz does not satisfy this condition, we can only support a one-dimensional decomposition.\n\nAlgorithm for one-dimensional decompositions\n\nThis algorithm requires a one-dimensional decomposition with either Rx = 1 or Ry = 1, and is important to support two-dimensional transforms.\n\nFor one-dimensional decompositions, we place the decomposed direction last. If the number of ranks is Rh = max(Rx, Ry), this algorithm requires that  both Nx > Rh and Ny > Rh. The resulting flow of transposes and transforms is similar to the two-dimensional case.

TX, TY, and TZ specify whether the x-, y-, and z directions are             Periodic, Bounded, or Flat. The topology Flat indicates that a model does             not vary in those directions so that derivatives and interpolation are zero.             The default is topology = (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded).\nextent: A tuple prescribing the physical extent of the grid in non-Flat directions, e.g.,           (Lx, Ly, Lz). All directions are constructed with regular grid spacing and the domain           (in the case that no direction is Flat) is 0  x  L_x, 0  y  L_y, and           -L_z  z  0, which is most appropriate for oceanic applications in which z = 0           usually is the ocean's surface.\nx, y, and z: Each of x, y, z are either (i) 2-tuples that specify the end points of the domain                    in their respect directions (in which case scalar values may be used in Flat                    directions), or (ii) arrays or functions of the corresponding indices i, j, or k                    that specify the locations of cell faces in the x-, y-, or z-direction, respectively.                    For example, to prescribe the cell faces in z we need to provide a function that takes                    k as argument and returns the location of the faces for indices k = 1 through k = Nz + 1,                    where Nz is the size of the stretched z dimension.\n\nNote: Either extent, or all of x, y, and z must be specified.\n\nhalo: A tuple of integers that specifies the size of the halo region of cells surrounding         the physical interior for each non-Flat direction. The default is 3 halo cells in every direction.\n\nThe physical extent of the domain can be specified either via x, y, and z keyword arguments indicating the left and right endpoints of each dimensions, e.g., x = (-π, π) or via the extent argument, e.g., extent = (Lx, Ly, Lz), which specifies the extent of each dimension in which case 0  x  L_x, 0  y  L_y, and -L_z  z  0.\n\nA grid topology may be specified via a tuple assigning one of Periodic, Bounded, and, Flat to each dimension. By default, a horizontally periodic grid topology (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded) is assumed.\n\nConstants are stored using floating point values of type FT. By default this is Float64. Make sure to specify the desired FT if not using Float64.\n\nGrid properties\n\n(Nx, Ny, Nz) :: Int: Number of physical points in the (x y z)-direction.\n(Hx, Hy, Hz) :: Int: Number of halo points in the (x y z)-direction.\n(Lx, Ly, Lz) :: FT: Physical extent of the grid in the (x y z)-direction.\n(Δxᶜᵃᵃ, Δyᵃᶜᵃ, Δzᵃᵃᶜ): Spacings in the (x y z)-directions between the cell faces.

Total number of grid points is Ns cubed.","category":"page"},{"location":"appendix/benchmarks/","page":"Performance benchmarks","title":"Performance benchmarks","text":"Oceananigans v0.58.8\nJulia Version 1.6.1\nCommit 6aaedecc44 (2021-04-23 05:59 UTC)\nPlatform Info:\n  OS: Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)\n  CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4216 CPU @ 2.10GHz\n  WORD_SIZE: 64\n  LIBM: libopenlibm\n  LLVM: libLLVM-11.0.1 (ORCJIT, cascadelake)\nEnvironment:\n  EBVERSIONJULIA = 1.6.1\n  JULIA_DEPOT_PATH = :\n  EBROOTJULIA = /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/avx2/Core/julia/1.6.1\n  EBDEVELJULIA = /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2020/avx2/Core/julia/1.6.1/easybuild/avx2-Core-julia-1.6.1-easybuild-devel\n  JULIA_LOAD_PATH = :\n  GPU: Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB\n\n                                            Nonhydrostatic model benchmarks\n┌───────────────┬─────────────┬─────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬──────────┬────────┬─────────┐\n│ Architectures │ Float_types │  Ns │        min │     median │       mean │        max │   memory │ allocs │ samples │\n├───────────────┼─────────────┼─────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────┼─────────┤\n│           CPU │     Float32 │  32 │  34.822 ms │  34.872 ms │  35.278 ms │  38.143 ms │ 1.38 MiB │   2302 │      10 │\n│           CPU │     Float32 │  64 │ 265.408 ms │ 265.571 ms │ 265.768 ms │ 267.765 ms │ 1.38 MiB │   2302 │      10 │\n│           CPU │     Float32 │ 128 │    2.135 s │    2.135 s │    2.136 s │    2.138 s │ 1.38 MiB │   2302 │       3 │\n│           CPU │     Float32 │ 256 │   17.405 s │   17.405 s │   17.405 s │   17.405 s │ 1.38 MiB │   2302 │       1 │\n│           CPU │     Float64 │  32 │  37.022 ms │  37.179 ms │  37.335 ms │  39.017 ms │ 1.77 MiB │   2302 │      10 │\n│           CPU │     Float64 │  64 │ 287.944 ms │ 288.154 ms │ 288.469 ms │ 290.838 ms │ 1.77 MiB │   2302 │      10 │\n│           CPU │     Float64 │ 128 │    2.326 s │    2.326 s │    2.326 s │    2.327 s │ 1.77 MiB │   2302 │       3 │\n│           CPU │     Float64 │ 256 │   19.561 s │   19.561 s │   19.561 s │   19.561 s │ 1.77 MiB │   2302 │       1 │\n│           GPU │     Float32 │  32 │   4.154 ms │   4.250 ms │   4.361 ms │   5.557 ms │ 2.13 MiB │   6033 │      10 │\n│           GPU │     Float32 │  64 │   3.383 ms │   3.425 ms │   3.889 ms │   8.028 ms │ 2.13 MiB │   6077 │      10 │\n│           GPU │     Float32 │ 128 │   5.564 ms │   5.580 ms │   6.095 ms │  10.725 ms │ 2.15 MiB │   7477 │      10 │\n│           GPU │     Float32 │ 256 │  38.685 ms │  38.797 ms │  39.548 ms │  46.442 ms │ 2.46 MiB │  27721 │      10 │\n│           GPU │     Float64 │  32 │   3.309 ms │   3.634 ms │   3.802 ms │   5.844 ms │ 2.68 MiB │   6033 │      10 │\n│           GPU │     Float64 │  64 │   3.330 ms │   3.648 ms │   4.008 ms │   7.808 ms │ 2.68 MiB │   6071 │      10 │\n│           GPU │     Float64 │ 128 │   7.209 ms │   7.323 ms │   8.313 ms │  17.259 ms │ 2.71 MiB │   8515 │      10 │\n│           GPU │     Float64 │ 256 │  46.614 ms │  56.444 ms │  55.461 ms │  56.563 ms │ 3.17 MiB │  38253 │      10 │\n└───────────────┴─────────────┴─────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴──────────┴────────┴─────────┘\n\n      Nonhydrostatic model CPU to GPU speedup\n┌─────────────┬─────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐\n│ Float_types │  Ns │ speedup │  memory │  allocs │\n├─────────────┼─────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤\n│     Float32 │  32 │ 8.20434 │ 1.53786 │ 2.62076 │\n│     Float32 │  64 │ 77.5308 │ 1.53835 │ 2.63988 │\n│     Float32 │ 128 │ 382.591 │ 1.55378 │ 3.24805 │\n│     Float32 │ 256 │ 448.619 │ 1.77688 │ 12.0421 │\n│     Float64 │  32 │ 10.2308 │ 1.51613 │ 2.62076 │\n│     Float64 │  64 │ 78.9952 │ 1.51646 │ 2.63727 │\n│     Float64 │ 128 │ 317.663 │ 1.53759 │ 3.69896 │\n│     Float64 │ 256 │ 346.554 │ 1.79466 │ 16.6173 │\n└─────────────┴─────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘","category":"page"},{"location":"appendix/benchmarks/","page":"Performance benchmarks","title":"Performance benchmarks","text":"Like the shallow water model, it can be seen at grid size 64^3 that the GPU is beginning to be saturated as speedups rapidly increase.
