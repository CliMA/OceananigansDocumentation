This staggered storage of variables is more complicated than the collocated grid arrangement but is beneficial as it avoids the odd-even decoupling between the pressure and velocity if they are stored at the same positions. Odd-even decoupling is a discretization error that can occur on collocated grids and which leads to checkerboard patterns in the solutions (See the CFD Online article on staggered grids). Another way to look at this is that the discrete Poisson equation used to enforce incompressibility has a null space. The null space often manifests itself in producing solutions with checkerboard pressure fields. The staggering of variables effectively eliminates the null space; however, when it is used in the context of curvilinear coordinates its consistent implementation is complicated because it requires the use of contravariant velocity components and variable coordinate base vectors [See A.
