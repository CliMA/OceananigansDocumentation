Define the areas of the cell faces as <span>$A_x = \Delta y \Delta z$</span>, <span>$A_y = \Delta x \Delta z$</span>, and <span>$A_z = \Delta x \Delta y$</span>. Each cell encloses a volume <span>$V = \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z$</span>. Velocities <span>$(u,\v,w) = (\v_x, \v_y, \v_z)$</span> are normal to the requisite face, that is, they are defined on the faces of the cells.</p><p><img src="../assets/single_volume.png" alt="Schematic of a single volume"/></p><p>Tracer variables, which are cell averages, are temperature <span>$T$</span> and salinity <span>$S$</span> and thus are stored at the cell centers. Pressure <span>$p$</span> and density <span>$\rho$</span> are also defined at the cell centers. The faces of the cells are coincident with three orthogonal coordinate axes (Cartesian in this case). Vorticity <span>$\b{\omega}=\bnabla\times\bv$</span> and certain intermediate quantities are stored at the cell edges. (In 2D it would more correct to say the cell corners, however, in 3D variables like vorticity <span>$\b{\omega}$</span> lie at the same vertical levels as the cell-centered variables and so they really lie at the cell edges. In addition to being technically correct, we abbreviate cell centers as <span>$c$</span> and cell faces as <span>$f$</span> in subscripts, so edges can use <span>$e$</span> while corners would conflict with cell centers.)</p><p>The cells are indexed by <span>$(i, j, k)$</span> where <span>$i \in \{1, 2, \dots, N_x\}$</span>, <span>$j \in \{1, 2, \dots, N_y\}$</span>, and <span>$k \in \{1, 2, \dots, N_z\}$</span> with <span>$k=1$</span> corresponding to the top and <span>$k=N_z$</span> corresponding to the bottom. (To solve the equations on the sphere, the &quot;quads&quot; used to grid the sphere are appropriately defined including geometrical information and the <span>$G$</span>&#39;s in the equations have to be modified slightly to include metric terms. But the underlying algorithm remains the same.)</p><p>While there are <span>$N$</span> cells and cells centers per dimension and <span>$N+1$</span> cell faces and cell edges per dimension, all fields are stored as <span>$N_x \times N_y \times N_z$</span> fields. The reason for this is that for the case of periodic boundary conditions, the values at face <span>$N+1$</span> equal the values at face <span>$1$</span> so there is no need to store an extra face, and for walled boundaries, faces <span>$N+1$</span> and <span>$1$</span> both represent walls so again there is no need to store an extra face.

To this effect a number of strategies are employed to ensure the discretized equations satisfy the same conservative properties that the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfy, and to ensure that the numerical solution is stable.</p><p>The main strategies involve the use of a staggered grid and the splitting of the pressure field into three components.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Staggered-grid-1" href="#Staggered-grid-1">Staggered grid</a></h3><p>As shown in the schematic of a single volume and discussed earlier the velocities are defined as averages over faces while other quantities are cell averages stored at the cell centers. This staggered storage of variables is more complicated than the collocated grid arrangement but is beneficial as it avoids the odd-even decoupling between the pressure and velocity if they are stored at the same positions. Odd-even decoupling is a discretization error that can occur on collocated grids and which leads to checkerboard patterns in the solutions (See the CFD Online article on <a href="https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Staggered_grid">staggered grids</a>). Another way to look at this is that the discrete Poisson equation used to enforce incompressibility has a null space. The null space often manifests itself in producing solutions with checkerboard pressure fields. The staggering of variables effectively eliminates the null space; however, when it is used in the context of curvilinear coordinates its consistent implementation is complicated because it requires the use of contravariant velocity components and variable coordinate base vectors [See A. S. Dvinsky &amp; J. K. Dukowicz, <a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.mit.edu/science/article/pii/0045793093900336">Null-space-free methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on non-staggered curvilinear grids</a>, <em>Computers &amp; Fluids</em> <strong>22</strong>(6), pp. 685–696 (1993)].</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Splitting-of-the-pressure-field-1" href="#Splitting-of-the-pressure-field-1">Splitting of the pressure field</a></h3><p>Another strategy employed is to split the pressure field into three components</p><div>\[\beq \label{eqn:pressure_split}
    p(x,y,z) = p_S(x,y) + p_{HY}(x,y,z) + q\,p_{NH}(x,y,z) ,
\eeq\]</div><p>where the first term, <span>$p_S$</span>, is the surface pressure–-the pressure exerted by the fluid under the rigid lid at the surface; it is only a function of horizontal position and is found by inverting a 2D elliptic Poisson equation. The second term is the hydrostatic pressure <span>$p_{HY}$</span> defined in terms of the weight of water in a vertical column above the depth <span>$z$</span>,</p><div>\[\beq \label{eqn:hydrostaticPressure}
    \p{p_{HY}}{z} + g&#39; = 0 ,
\eeq\]</div><p>where <span>$g&#39; = g(\delta \rho / \rho_0)$</span> is the <em>reduced gravity</em>. The third term is the non-hydrostatic pressure <span>$p_{NH}$</span> which must be found by inverting a 3D elliptic equation analogous to \eqref{eqn:ellipticPressure}. Note that the parameter <span>$q$</span> in, for example, \eqref{eqn:pressure_split}, is a trace parameter that is set to zero in HY and to one in the NHY algorithm.
